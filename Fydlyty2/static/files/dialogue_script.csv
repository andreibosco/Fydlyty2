Patient,Hello Doctor. Nice to see you today.
Doctor,Hi Mrs. Wilson. How are you feeling today?
Patient,A bit better.
Doctor,That is good to hear. Are you still feeling nauseous?
Patient,I haven't felt sick to my stomach since you switched my medication.
Doctor,Great. So your test results came in this morning.
Patient,It is about time. Is it good news or bad?
Doctor,I guess it is a bit of both. Which do you want first?
Patient,Please let me have the bad news first. I want to get over it.
Doctor,Okay. It looks like you are going to need surgery to remove the tumour from your leg. After the operation you are going to have to stay off your feet for at least three weeks. That means no household chores.
Patient,I was afraid you were going to say that.
Doctor,Now for the good news. The biopsy shows that the tumour is benign which means it is not cancerous. We are going to take it out anyway just to be on the safe side.
Patient,Wow! that is a load off my mind. Thanks Doctor.
Doctor,Do not get too excited yet. We still need to get to the bottom of all of this weight loss.
Patient,I have probably just been so worried about this stupid lump.
Doctor,These things often are stress related. But we are still going to do a few blood tests just to rule a few things out.
Patient,Things like what Doctor? Ermm cancer?
Doctor,Actually I am thinking more along the lines of a food allergy.
Patient,Oh that should not be too bad. Well at least comparatively.
Doctor,Yes Mrs. Wilson. You do not have to worry about anything.
Patient,Thanks Doctor. I will see you next week then?
Doctor,Sure. Have a great day.
